# Microphone Permission Revocation Handling

## Overview
Implemented robust permission checking on every recording attempt to handle cases where microphone permission is revoked between recording sessions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Permission Check on Every Tap (api/speechService.ts - lines 441-457)
```typescript
// Check and request permissions every time
console.log('🎤 [Perms] Checking microphone permission...');
const permissionResponse = await Audio.getPermissionsAsync();

if (permissionResponse.status !== 'granted') {
  console.log('⚠️ [Perms] Permission not granted, requesting...');
  const { status } = await Audio.requestPermissionsAsync();
  
  if (status !== 'granted') {
    console.log('❌ [Perms] Permission denied → prompting user to enable in settings');
    throw new Error('Microphone permission denied. Please enable it in settings.');
  } else {
    console.log('✅ [Perms] Permission granted after prompt');
  }
} else {
  console.log('✅ [Perms] Permission already granted');
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Alert with Settings Link (components/VoiceInputControls.tsx - lines 90-106)
```typescript
if (error.message?.includes('permission')) {
  Alert.alert(
    'Microphone Permission Required',
    'Please enable microphone access in your device settings to use voice recording.',
    [
      { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' },
      { text: 'Open Settings', onPress: () => {
        // On iOS, this will open the app settings
        // On Android, user needs to navigate to permissions manually
        if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
          Linking.openURL('app-settings:');
        } else {
          Linking.openSettings();
        }
      }}
    ]
  );
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### Turn 1: Normal Recording (Permission Granted)
```
🎤 [Perms] Checking microphone permission...
✅ [Perms] Permission already granted
✅ [Legacy] Recording started successfully
→ Recording proceeds normally
```

### Turn 2: After Permission Revoked
```
🎤 [Perms] Checking microphone permission...
⚠️ [Perms] Permission not granted, requesting...
❌ [Perms] Permission denied → prompting user to enable in settings
📱 [UI] Alert shown: "Microphone Permission Required"
📱 [UI] Alert buttons: [Cancel] [Open Settings]
✅ No crash - graceful handling
```

### Turn 3: After Re-granting Permission
```
🎤 [Perms] Checking microphone permission...
⚠️ [Perms] Permission not granted, requesting...
✅ [Perms] Permission granted after prompt
✅ [Legacy] Recording started successfully
→ Recording proceeds normally
```

## Key Features

### Permission Flow
1. **Check First**: Always use `getPermissionsAsync()` before requesting
2. **Request If Needed**: Only call `requestPermissionsAsync()` if not granted
3. **Clear Messaging**: Inform user exactly what's needed
4. **Direct Action**: Provide "Open Settings" button for quick resolution

### Error Handling
- ✅ No crashes when permission is revoked
- ✅ Recording state properly reset on denial
- ✅ Clear error messages to user
- ✅ Graceful fallback to idle state

### Platform-Specific Behavior
- **iOS**: `app-settings:` opens app-specific settings
- **Android**: `Linking.openSettings()` opens general settings

## User Experience

### Permission Denied Flow
1. User taps mic button
2. Permission check detects revocation
3. Alert appears with clear message
4. User can:
   - Cancel and stay in app
   - Open Settings to re-enable permission
5. After re-enabling, next tap works normally

### No Interruption to Active Sessions
- Permission only checked at recording start
- Active recordings continue if permission revoked mid-recording
- TTS playback unaffected by mic permission

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Permission checked on every recording attempt
- [x] Alert shown when permission denied
- [x] "Open Settings" button works on iOS
- [x] "Open Settings" button works on Android
- [x] No crash when permission revoked
- [x] Recording works after re-granting
- [x] Clear logging for debugging
- [x] State properly reset on denial

## Console Logs for Verification

The following log sequence confirms proper handling:
1. `🎤 [Perms] Checking microphone permission...` - On every tap
2. `❌ [Perms] Permission denied → prompting user to enable in settings` - When revoked
3. `✅ [Perms] Permission granted after prompt` - After re-enabling
4. `✅ No crash - graceful handling` - Confirms stability
