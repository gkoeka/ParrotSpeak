# 2-Second Silence Timer - Final Solution

## Problem Identified: TRIPLE TIMER BUG

The code was creating **3 separate timers** that all fired after 2 seconds:
1. Timer when speech detected
2. Fallback timer for duration changes  
3. **Initial timer that ALWAYS fired** (the bug!)

This caused recording to stop after exactly 2 seconds regardless of whether the user was speaking.

## Solution Implemented

### Before (Buggy Code):
```javascript
// Timer 1: On speech detection
if (status.metering > -35) {
  silenceTimer = setTimeout(..., 2000);
}
// Timer 2: Fallback
else if (duration increases) {
  silenceTimer = setTimeout(..., 2000);
}
// Timer 3: ALWAYS SET (BUG!)
silenceTimer = setTimeout(..., 2000); // This always fired!
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
let firstUpdate = true;

if (status.metering > -35) {
  // Speech detected - reset timer
  clearTimeout(silenceTimer);
  silenceTimer = setTimeout(..., 2000);
} else if (firstUpdate) {
  // Only set initial timer if no speech on first update
  silenceTimer = setTimeout(..., 2000);
}
firstUpdate = false;
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Recording starts** → Timer NOT immediately set
2. **First status update arrives**:
   - If speech detected → Set timer for 2s from now
   - If silence → Set timer for 2s 
3. **Subsequent updates**:
   - Speech detected → Clear and reset timer
   - Silence continues → Timer keeps counting
4. **After 2s of silence** → Recording auto-stops

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Scenario 1: Immediate Speech
- Tap to speak
- Start talking immediately
- Timer should reset each time speech detected
- Stop talking
- Should auto-stop after 2 seconds of silence

### ✅ Scenario 2: Delayed Speech  
- Tap to speak
- Wait 1 second
- Start talking
- Should NOT stop at 2-second mark
- Should only stop 2s after silence

### ✅ Scenario 3: Intermittent Speech
- Tap to speak
- Talk for 1 second
- Pause for 1 second
- Talk again
- Timer should reset on second speech
- Should stop 2s after final silence

### ✅ Scenario 4: Manual Stop
- Tap to speak
- Tap again before 2 seconds
- Should stop immediately
- No double-stop issues

## Key Improvements

1. **Single Timer Logic** - Only one timer active at a time
2. **Proper Reset** - Timer clears and resets on speech
3. **First Update Check** - Initial timer only if starting in silence
4. **Guard Flags** - Prevents double-stop issues
5. **Clear Logging** - Easy to debug with console messages

## Status: READY FOR TESTING

The 2-second silence timer should now work correctly:
- Stops after 2 seconds of ACTUAL silence
- Not after 2 seconds from start
- Properly resets when speech is detected
