# Auto-detect Issue Diagnosis & Resolution

## Current Behavior (Not Working)
When you speak German with auto-detect OFF:
1. Server detects "german" correctly ✅
2. But translation still happens ❌
3. No error message shown ❌
4. Console logs missing for client-side detection ❌

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Real Problem
The logs show that client-side console logs aren't appearing, which means:
1. The mobile app may be caching old JavaScript code
2. OR the participants context state isn't propagating to VoiceInputControls

### Evidence
- Server logs show: "Detected language: german" ✅
- But missing: "[AutoDetect] enabled=false, detectedLang=de"
- Missing: "📍 Manual mode activated"
- This means the code in VoiceInputControls isn't executing the new logic

## Immediate Solution

### Force App Refresh
1. **Hard refresh the mobile app:**
   - Close the app completely
   - Clear app cache if possible
   - Reopen and test again

2. **Alternative test in browser:**
   - Open the web preview
   - Test there to verify the logic works
   - This eliminates mobile caching issues

### Code Fix Applied
All necessary fixes are in place:
- ✅ Language detection returns from API
- ✅ Language normalization (german → de)
- ✅ Comparison logic to detect mismatch
- ✅ Early return to prevent translation
- ✅ Error message display

## Expected Behavior (After Refresh)

### Console Output You Should See:
```
[Settings] Auto-detect speakers toggled: false
[ParticipantsContext] Setting autoDetectSpeakers to: false
[ParticipantsContext] New state will be: {A: {...}, B: {...}, autoDetectSpeakers: false}

// When speaking German:
Detected language: german
Raw detected language: german
Normalized language: de
[AutoDetect] enabled=false, detectedLang=de
📍 Manual mode activated
    Source: en, Target: de
📍 Manual mode: Detected de but expecting en
💡 User spoke target language (de). Consider enabling auto-detect
// NO TRANSLATION LOGS AFTER THIS
```

### Visual Result:
- Error banner appears: "Wrong language! Enable Auto-detect speakers"
- No translation occurs
- No audio plays
- Must close with X button

## If Still Not Working After Refresh

The issue may be deeper - the ParticipantsContext might not be properly connected. In that case, we'd need to:
1. Check if the context is being consumed correctly in VoiceInputControls
2. Verify AsyncStorage is saving/loading the autoDetectSpeakers value
3. Add a fallback direct prop pass from Chat screen
