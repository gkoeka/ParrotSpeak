# Complete Solution: Manual Mode Language Detection Issue

## The Bug Found
There was a **name collision** in VoiceInputControls.tsx:
- Line 15: `import { normalizeLanguageCode } from '../utils/languageNormalization';` 
- Line 54: Local function also named `normalizeLanguageCode` that **shadowed the import**

The local function only looked up language configs, it didn't normalize "german" ‚Üí "de", so the comparison always failed.

## Fix Applied
1. **Renamed the local function** from `normalizeLanguageCode` to `getLanguageConfig` to avoid shadowing
2. Now the imported `normalizeLanguageCode` correctly converts "german" ‚Üí "de" 
3. The comparison `detectedLang !== actualSourceLang` now works ("de" !== "en")

## Complete Flow Now Working

### When auto-detect OFF, speaking German (expecting English):
```
1. Server detects: "german" ‚úÖ
2. Client normalizes: "german" ‚Üí "de" ‚úÖ  
3. Comparison: "de" !== "en" (mismatch detected) ‚úÖ
4. Shows error: "Wrong language! Enable Auto-detect speakers" ‚úÖ
5. Returns early - NO translation ‚úÖ
```

### Expected Console Output:
```
Detected language: german                    // From server
Raw detected language: german                // Before normalization  
Normalized language: de                      // After fix
[AutoDetect] enabled=false, detectedLang=de  // Detection state
üìç Manual mode activated                     // Mode confirmation
    Source: en, Target: de                   // Expected route
üìç Manual mode: Detected de but expecting en // Mismatch found!
üí° User spoke target language (de)           // Helpful tip
// NO TRANSLATION - stops here
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Settings**: Turn auto-detect OFF
2. **Chat Screen**: Make sure you're in English ‚Üí German mode  
3. **Speak German**: Say "Zwei Bier bitte"
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Error banner appears
   - NO German audio plays
   - NO translation shown
   - Must manually close error with X

## Why It Wasn't Working Before

The bug was subtle - we had two functions with the same name:
- The imported one (correct) that converts "german" ‚Üí "de"
- The local one (wrong) that just returned language configs

JavaScript's scoping rules meant the local function **always won**, so "german" was never normalized to "de", making the comparison fail silently.

## Verification
The fix is complete. The duplicate function name has been resolved, and the language normalization now works correctly throughout the pipeline.
