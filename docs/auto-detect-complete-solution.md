# Auto-detect Language Mismatch - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
When you spoke German with auto-detect OFF (expecting English), the system was:
1. Not detecting the language mismatch
2. Still translating (producing nonsense)
3. Not showing the error tip

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### Issue 1: No Language Detection from API
- **Problem:** API returned only text, not detected language
- **Fix:** Changed response format from 'text' to 'verbose_json' to get language detection
- **Files:** `server/services/openai.ts`, `server/routes.ts`

### Issue 2: Language Code Mismatch
- **Problem:** Whisper returns "german" but code compared against "de"
- **Fix:** Created language normalization utility to convert "german" → "de"
- **Files:** `utils/languageNormalization.ts`, `components/VoiceInputControls.tsx`

### Issue 3: No Language Hint Constraint
- **Problem:** Passing source language hint forced Whisper to transcribe in that language
- **Fix:** Removed language hint to allow auto-detection
- **File:** `components/VoiceInputControls.tsx`

## Final Behavior

### With Auto-detect OFF (Manual Mode):

#### Speaking Correct Language (English):
1. User speaks English
2. System detects English
3. Normal translation: English → German
4. No error shown

#### Speaking Wrong Language (German):
1. User speaks German
2. System detects German (via Whisper auto-detection)
3. Compares: detected "de" ≠ expected "en"
4. Shows error: "Wrong language! Enable Auto-detect speakers"
5. **NO translation occurs** - process stops
6. User must close tip with X button

### With Auto-detect ON:
1. User speaks any language
2. System detects and routes correctly
3. Translates in appropriate direction
4. No errors shown

## Technical Implementation

### Language Detection Flow:
```
Audio → Whisper API (no hint) → {text: "...", language: "german"}
→ Normalize: "german" → "de"
→ Compare: "de" vs expected "en"
→ Mismatch detected → Show error, stop processing
```

### Key Code Changes:
1. **API Response:** Returns both text and language
2. **Normalization:** Maps full names to ISO codes
3. **Early Exit:** Returns immediately on language mismatch
4. **No Forced Hints:** Whisper auto-detects freely

## Testing Checklist
- [x] German with auto-detect OFF → Error tip only, no translation
- [x] English with auto-detect OFF → Normal operation
- [x] German with auto-detect ON → Routes to German speaker
- [x] English with auto-detect ON → Routes to English speaker
- [x] Error tip requires manual dismissal (X button)

The solution ensures proper language detection, clear error feedback, and encourages use of the auto-detect feature when appropriate.
