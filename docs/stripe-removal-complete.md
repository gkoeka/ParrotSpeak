# Stripe Code Removal Complete

## Summary
Successfully removed all unused Stripe code from the codebase after switching to In-App Purchases (IAP) model.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Server-Side Code
- **server/services/webhook.ts** - Entire 151-line Stripe webhook service (deleted)
- **server/routes.ts** - Stripe import, initialization, and CSP headers removed
- **server/auth.ts** - Stripe fields removed from TypeScript interface

### 2. User API Responses
- **Login endpoint** - Removed `stripeCustomerId` and `stripeSubscriptionId` fields
- **User profile endpoint** - Removed Stripe fields from responses

### 3. Security Headers
- **CSP (Content Security Policy)** - Removed unnecessary Stripe domain permissions:
  - `https://js.stripe.com`
  - `https://api.stripe.com`
  - `https://checkout.stripe.com`
  - `https://hooks.stripe.com`

### 4. Legal Documents
- **Privacy Policy** - Updated payment processing references from Stripe to app store
- **Cookie Policy** - Updated third-party cookie references from Stripe to app store

### 5. Backup Files Removed
- `server/routes_broken.ts`
- `server/routes_clean.ts`
- `server/routes_old.ts`
- `client/src/pages/checkout-stripe-backup.tsx`

## What Remains (Database Schema)
The following database fields remain and require migration:
- `stripe_customer_id` (database column)
- `stripe_subscription_id` (database column)

These are defined in `shared/schema.ts` but are not used in business logic. They can be safely removed with a database migration when ready.

## Testing Results
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ Authentication endpoints work correctly  
- ✅ User login returns clean response (no Stripe fields)
- ✅ Translation features still work
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ CSP headers properly restrict access to only needed domains

## Benefits Achieved
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface by removing unused Stripe domain permissions
- **Compliance**: Legal documents now accurately reflect payment processing
- **Maintenance**: 200+ lines of dead code removed
- **Clarity**: Codebase now focused entirely on IAP model
- **Performance**: Smaller bundle size without Stripe dependencies

## Next Steps (Optional)
If desired, a database migration can be created to remove the unused Stripe columns:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN stripe_customer_id;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN stripe_subscription_id;
```

## Status: ✅ Complete
All Stripe code has been safely removed from the active codebase. The application now runs entirely on the IAP model with no Stripe dependencies.
