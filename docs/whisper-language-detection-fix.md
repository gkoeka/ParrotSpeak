# Whisper Language Detection Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Identified
When you spoke German with auto-detect OFF:
1. Whisper was forced to transcribe in English mode (due to language hint)
2. Result: German speech → nonsense English text ("I had to go on a swipe here...")
3. Translation: Nonsense English → German (double nonsense!)

## Root Cause
The `processRecording` function was receiving `sourceLanguage` as a hint, forcing Whisper to transcribe in that specific language instead of auto-detecting.

## Solution Applied
Removed the language hint parameter from Whisper API calls:
- **Before:** `processRecording(uri, sourceLanguage)` - forced English mode
- **After:** `processRecording(uri, undefined)` - auto-detection enabled

## How It Works Now

### With Auto-detect OFF (Manual Mode):
1. **You speak German:** "Ich hätte gerne zwei Bier, bitte"
2. **Whisper auto-detects:** Correctly transcribes German text
3. **System detects mismatch:** German spoken but expecting English
4. **Shows tip:** "Enable Auto-detect speakers in Settings"
5. **Smart translation:** German → English (swapped direction)
6. **Result:** "I'd like two beers, please"

### With Auto-detect ON:
1. **You speak any language:** System detects it correctly
2. **Routes automatically:** To appropriate speaker (A or B)
3. **Translates correctly:** In the right direction

## Benefits
- Proper language detection in all scenarios
- Meaningful translations even with language mismatches
- Better user experience with accurate transcriptions
- Auto-detect feature works as intended
