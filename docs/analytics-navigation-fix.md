# Analytics Navigation Fix - January 9, 2025

## Problem
When clicking "Analytics Dashboard" from Settings, the Chat tab was being highlighted instead of the Settings tab. This was confusing for users as they expected to stay in the Settings context.

## Root Cause
The Analytics screen was registered in the `ChatStack` navigator but accessed from Settings, causing the navigation to jump to the Chat tab.

## Solution
Moved the Analytics screen from `ChatStack` to `SettingsStack` to maintain proper tab context.

## Changes Made

### 1. MainTabNavigator.tsx
- **Removed** Analytics from `ChatStackParamList`
- **Added** Analytics to `SettingsStackParamList` 
- **Removed** `<ChatStack.Screen name="Analytics" />` from ChatStackNavigator
- **Added** `<SettingsStack.Screen name="Analytics" />` to SettingsStackNavigator

### 2. SettingsScreen.tsx
- Changed Analytics navigation from:
  ```typescript
  screen: 'ChatTab', isTab: true, params: { screen: 'Analytics' }
  ```
  To:
  ```typescript
  screen: 'Analytics', isStack: true
  ```

### 3. HomeScreen.tsx
- Updated Analytics card navigation from:
  ```typescript
  navigation.navigate('Analytics')
  ```
  To:
  ```typescript
  navigation.navigate('SettingsTab', { screen: 'Analytics' })
  ```

## Result
✅ Analytics Dashboard now correctly stays within the Settings tab
✅ Settings tab remains highlighted when viewing Analytics
✅ Navigation flow is more intuitive and consistent
✅ All navigation paths to Analytics work correctly

## Navigation Flow
- **From Settings**: Settings Tab → Analytics (stays in Settings stack)
- **From Home**: Home → Settings Tab → Analytics (switches to Settings tab)

## Files Modified
- navigation/MainTabNavigator.tsx
