# Manual Mode Translation Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
When auto-detect is OFF and user speaks the target language (e.g., German when expecting English):
- **Before:** System forced English→German translation on German text, producing nonsense
- **Example:** "Ich hätte gerne zwei Bier, bitte" → "I had to go on a swipe here a bit though"

## Root Cause
The system was:
1. Correctly detecting the spoken language (German)
2. Showing the helpful tip about enabling auto-detect ✅
3. BUT still translating with forced source/target languages, ignoring the detection

## Fix Applied
Added intelligent translation correction in manual mode:
- When detected language matches target language, swap translation direction
- Translate from detected language back to expected source language
- This produces meaningful results even when "wrong" language is spoken

## New Behavior
When you speak German with auto-detect OFF (expecting English):
1. System detects German
2. Shows tip: "Enable Auto-detect speakers in Settings"
3. Translates German→English (swapped direction)
4. Result: "Ich hätte gerne zwei Bier, bitte" → "I'd like two beers, please"

## Benefits
- Meaningful translations even when speaking "wrong" language
- Better user experience - no nonsense output
- Tip still guides users to enable auto-detect
- Graceful handling of language mismatches
