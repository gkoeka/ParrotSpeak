# Auto-detect OFF Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When auto-detect is OFF and user speaks the target language instead of source:
- System was not handling this edge case properly
- Translation might fail or produce unexpected results

## Solution Implemented
Added proper handling in `VoiceInputControls.tsx`:

1. **Manual mode now forces A→B translation** regardless of detected language
2. **Added logging** to show when detected language differs from expected source
3. **Edge case handling** for when source and target languages are the same

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario: Auto-detect OFF, A=English, B=Spanish

**Test 1: Speaking English (expected source)**
```
Detected: en
Manual mode: en → es
Result: English transcription → Spanish translation
```

**Test 2: Speaking Spanish (target language)**
```
Detected: es
Manual mode: Detected es but forcing en → es
Result: Spanish transcription → Still attempts en → es translation
Note: Translation API will handle the mismatch appropriately
```

## Console Logs to Watch For
- `📍 Manual mode: en → es` - Normal case
- `📍 Manual mode: Detected es but forcing en → es` - Mismatch case
- `⚠️ Source and target are the same` - Edge case

## Testing Instructions
1. Go to Settings → Turn OFF "Auto-detect speakers"
2. Set A=English, B=Spanish
3. Record in English → Should translate to Spanish
4. Record in Spanish → Should still route as en→es (manual mode forces direction)
