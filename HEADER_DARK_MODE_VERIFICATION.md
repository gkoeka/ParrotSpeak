# Header Dark Mode Verification Report

## Implementation Complete ✓

### Changes Made:

1. **Centered ParrotSpeak Logo & Name**
   - Logo and text are now horizontally centered in the header
   - Used flex layout with 3 sections (left empty, center logo, right settings)
   - Settings icon remains on the right side

2. **Dark Mode Support Added**
   - Header background changes:
     - Light mode: White background (#fff)
     - Dark mode: Dark background (#1a1a1a)
   - Border color adjusts:
     - Light mode: Light border (#e9ecef)
     - Dark mode: Dark border (#333)
   - ParrotSpeak text color:
     - Light mode: Blue (#3366FF)
     - Dark mode: Lighter blue (#5B8FFF)

### Testing Steps:

1. **Verify Centering**
   - Sign in to the app
   - Check that "ParrotSpeak" logo and text appear centered in header
   - Settings icon should be on the right

2. **Test Dark Mode**
   - Go to Settings → Toggle Dark Mode ON
   - Header should immediately change to dark background
   - Text should be lighter blue for better contrast
   - Border should be darker

3. **Test Persistence**
   - Enable Dark Mode
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Dark mode should persist (header remains dark)

### Technical Details:
- Updated `components/Header.tsx` to use ThemeContext
- Modified `components/ParrotSpeakLogo.tsx` for dark mode text
- Uses flex layout for proper centering
- Dark mode preference persists via AsyncStorage

The header now provides a consistent, centered brand experience that adapts seamlessly to the user's theme preference.
