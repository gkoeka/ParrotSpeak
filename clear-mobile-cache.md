# Mobile App Cache Issue - Complete Solution

## The Problem
Your Expo Go app on your phone is caching the old JavaScript bundle, so it's not receiving the updated code with the manual mode fixes. This is why:
- Server-side detection works (logs show "german" detected)
- But client-side logic doesn't execute (no console logs appear)
- Translation still happens when it shouldn't

## Root Cause
Expo Go aggressively caches JavaScript bundles for performance. Even clearing the app cache doesn't always clear the Metro bundler cache on the server side.

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Force Complete Refresh (Recommended)
1. **On your phone:**
   - Close Expo Go completely (swipe it away from recent apps)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Expo Go ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Cache AND Clear Data
   - Restart your phone (important!)

2. **On Replit:**
   - Run this command to clear Metro cache and restart with fresh bundle:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .expo/metro/cache
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Reconnect:**
   - Open Expo Go fresh
   - Scan the QR code again
   - The app will download a completely fresh bundle

### Option 2: Version Bump Method
If Option 1 doesn't work, we can force a new bundle by changing the app version:

1. Update `app.json`:
   - Change version from "1.0.0" to "1.0.1"
   - This forces Expo to treat it as a new bundle

2. Restart the server with cache clear

3. Reconnect from Expo Go

### Option 3: Direct Testing Alternative
Use the Expo web preview to verify the fix works:
```bash
npx expo start --web
```
This bypasses mobile caching entirely.

## Verification
After refreshing, you should see these console logs when testing:
```
[Settings] Auto-detect speakers toggled: false
[AutoDetect] enabled=false, detectedLang=de
üìç Manual mode: Detected de but expecting en
```

## Why This Happens
- Expo Go caches bundles for offline use and performance
- The cache persists across app restarts
- Server restarts don't always invalidate client cache
- Metro bundler also has its own cache layer

## Permanent Fix Applied
I've added server-side validation that will work regardless of client caching:
- Server checks for language mismatch when auto-detect is OFF
- Returns `shouldPreventTranslation: true` flag
- Blocks translation at API level

This ensures the feature works even with cached code!
