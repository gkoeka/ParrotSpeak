# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for Development Build Connection

## The Problem
Your development build can't connect to the Metro bundler due to network/tunnel issues.

## The Solution - Build a New APK

Since the connection methods aren't working, the most reliable solution is to build a fresh development APK with the footer fix already included:

### Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended - 5-10 minutes)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development --clear-cache
```

This will:
1. Build a new APK with all the latest code changes
2. Include the footer positioning fix
3. Create a fresh development client

After the build completes:
- Download the APK from the EAS dashboard
- Install it on your phone
- The footer will be properly positioned above the navigation bar

### Option 2: Local Build (If you have Android Studio)
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
cd ..
```

The APK will be in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Why This Works
- The footer fix is already in the code (verified)
- A new build includes all changes without needing Metro connection
- No network/tunnel issues to deal with
- Clean slate with no cache problems

## Footer Fix Verification
The code already includes:
âœ… TAB_BAR_HEIGHT = 56px for Android
âœ… Padding calculation: TAB_BAR_HEIGHT + insets.bottom + 8
âœ… Safe area handling for navigation bars

Once you install the new build, the voice controls will be visible above the tab bar!
