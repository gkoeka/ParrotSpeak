# Critical Fix: Silence Timer Fallback Path

## Problem Identified
The 2-second silence timer was NOT working on devices without audio metering because:

### Root Cause (Line 638)
```javascript
// OLD BROKEN CODE:
isSpeech = durationChanged; // If duration is changing, assume activity
```

**Why it failed:**
- Recording duration ALWAYS increases, even during silence
- `durationChanged` was always `true` 
- System thought there was continuous speech
- Timer never armed → no auto-stop after 2 seconds

## Solution Applied
```javascript
// NEW FIXED CODE:
isSpeech = false; // Assume silence when no metering available
```

**Why it works:**
- When metering unavailable, assume silence by default
- Timer can now arm after grace period
- 2-second auto-stop will work on all devices

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### With Metering (iOS, some Android)
```
[SilenceTimer] grace active
[SilenceTimer] grace ended
[SilenceTimer] state -> silence     // Detected via metering
[SilenceTimer] armed (2000ms)
[SilenceTimer] elapsed → auto-stop
```

### Without Metering (some Android)
```
[SilenceTimer] fallback path: no metering
[SilenceTimer] grace active
[SilenceTimer] grace ended
[SilenceTimer] state -> silence     // Assumed due to no metering
[SilenceTimer] armed (2000ms)
[SilenceTimer] elapsed → auto-stop
```

## Impact
- ✅ 2-second auto-stop now works on ALL devices
- ✅ Fallback path properly handles missing metering
- ✅ Timer behavior consistent across platforms

## Test Instructions
1. Start recording
2. Remain silent (or stop speaking)
3. Should see auto-stop after 2 seconds
4. Check logs for "fallback path: no metering" if on affected device
