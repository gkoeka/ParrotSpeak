## Summary
- **Device:** iOS Simulator with metering support (showed `reset (speech)` logs)
- **Android Note:** Would show `reset (fallback)` instead due to no metering
- **All tests passed:** Timer properly armed, reset, and cleared
- **No memory leaks:** Timer always cleaned up on all stop paths
- **Guards working:** Double-tap prevented, idempotent stop functioning
- **Background handling:** Clean shutdown with timer cleared
