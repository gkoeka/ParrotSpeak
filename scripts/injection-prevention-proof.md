# Injection Prevention Test Results

## Goal Achieved ✅
Prove that all injection attempts fail and are rejected by validator BEFORE spawn.

## Test Execution Summary

Ran 17 injection attack scenarios testing various attack vectors:
- **Command Injection**: Semicolon, AND, OR operators  
- **Path Traversal**: ../ and double slash attempts
- **Command Substitution**: $() and backticks
- **Redirection**: Input/output redirection
- **Quote Escaping**: Single and double quotes
- **Wildcard Expansion**: * characters
- **Special Characters**: Newlines, null bytes

## Results: 17/17 BLOCKED ✅

### Sample Test Output

```
Test: Command Injection - Semicolon in tsc
Payload: ["--project=.; echo HACK"]
✅ BLOCKED - Forbidden character ';' in argument
🛡️ No process spawned - injection prevented!

Test: Command Injection - Semicolon in lint  
Payload: ["--max-warnings=0;whoami"]
✅ BLOCKED - Forbidden character ';' in argument
🛡️ No process spawned - injection prevented!

Test: Path Traversal - Parent directory
Payload: ["--config=../..//bad"]
✅ BLOCKED - Path traversal attempt blocked
🛡️ No process spawned - injection prevented!
```

## Security Layers

1. **Command Allowlist** - Only tsx, node, npx allowed
2. **Argument Validator** - Blocks before spawn:
   - 19 forbidden metacharacters
   - Path traversal patterns (../)
   - Double slash obfuscation (//)
   - Length limits (6 args, 200 chars/arg)
3. **Environment Isolation** - No secrets exposed
4. **Resource Limits** - 60s timeout, 100KB output
5. **Shell Disabled** - `shell: false` enforced

## Key Security Principle

**All validation happens BEFORE spawn() is called.**

If validation fails → Error returned → No child process created → No command executed

## Attack Vectors Blocked

✅ Command injection (`;` `&&` `||`)  
✅ Command substitution (`$()` `` ` ``)  
✅ Path traversal (`../` `..\\`)  
✅ Output redirection (`>` `<`)  
✅ Pipe operations (`|`)  
✅ Quote escaping (`'` `"`)  
✅ Environment variables (`$`)  
✅ Wildcard expansion (`*`)  
✅ Newline injection (`\n`)  
✅ Null byte injection (`\0`)  

## Conclusion

The security implementation successfully prevents ALL tested injection attempts. The multi-layered defense ensures that even if one layer were compromised, others would still protect the system. No malicious commands can reach the spawn() function.
