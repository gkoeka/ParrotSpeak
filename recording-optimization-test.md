    audioEncoder: AAC, 
    sampleRate: 16000,     // ✅ Reduced from 44100
    numberOfChannels: 1,    // ✅ Mono instead of stereo
    bitRate: 24000         // ✅ 24kbps instead of 128kbps
  },
  ios: { 
    extension: '.m4a', 
    outputFormat: MPEG4AAC, 
    audioQuality: LOW,      // ✅ Low quality for smaller files
    sampleRate: 16000,      // ✅ Optimized for Whisper
    numberOfChannels: 1,    // ✅ Mono channel
    bitRate: 24000         // ✅ 24kbps bitrate
  }
}
```

### 2. Audio Mode Configuration
