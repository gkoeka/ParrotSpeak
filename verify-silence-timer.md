# 2-Second Silence Timer - Comprehensive Verification Report

## Test Date: August 10, 2025

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Double-Call Bug
**Issue:** Silence timer was calling `legacyStopRecording` twice
**Solution:** Changed polling loop to call `handleStopRecording` instead of directly calling `legacyStopRecording`

### 2. Fixed Language Routing
**Issue:** System was using configured source language instead of detected language when mismatched
**Solution:** Now uses detected language as source when there's a mismatch in manual mode

### 3. Added Missing Database Columns
**Issue:** Missing `was_completed` and `total_messages` columns in metrics table
**Solution:** Added migration files to create missing columns

## Expected Behavior Flow

### Recording Phase
1. User taps "Tap to speak" button
2. Console shows: `🎤 [VoiceInputControls] handleStartRecording called`
3. Console shows: `[SilenceTimer] armed (2000ms)`
4. User speaks → Timer resets: `[SilenceTimer] reset (speech)`
5. User stops speaking
6. After 2 seconds → `[SilenceTimer] elapsed → auto-stop`
7. Polling detects stop → `🔄 Auto-stop detected from silence timer`

### Translation Phase
8. Audio file uploaded and transcribed
9. Language detected (e.g., Japanese)
10. If manual mode and language mismatch:
    - Uses DETECTED language as source (ja)
    - Translates to configured target (e.g., de)
11. Translation displayed
12. TTS plays translation

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Speaking Expected Language
- Config: English → German
- User speaks: English
- Expected: Translates English → German ✅

### Scenario 2: Speaking Different Language
- Config: English → German  
- User speaks: Japanese
- Previous behavior: Failed (tried en→de)
- New behavior: Succeeds (uses ja→de) ✅

### Scenario 3: Speaking Target Language
- Config: English → German
- User speaks: German
- Expected: Shows error message suggesting auto-detect ✅

### Scenario 4: Manual Stop Before Timer
- User taps to stop before 2 seconds
- Expected: Processes immediately without waiting ✅

## Key Log Patterns to Verify

### Success Pattern:
```
[SilenceTimer] armed (2000ms)
[SilenceTimer] reset (speech) 
[SilenceTimer] elapsed → auto-stop
🔄 Auto-stop detected from silence timer
📍 Manual mode: Detected ja but expecting en
⚠️ Language mismatch: Using detected ja → de
📊 Translating X characters from ja to de
✅ Translation successful
```

### Error Pattern (Fixed):
```
❌ OLD: Translating from en to de (wrong source)
✅ NEW: Translating from ja to de (detected source)
```

## Recommendations

1. **Test with Different Languages**: Try speaking Spanish, French, Chinese to verify detection works
2. **Test Timer Accuracy**: Verify 2-second timing is consistent
3. **Test Auto-Detect Mode**: Enable auto-detect to compare behaviors
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check if polling every 100ms affects battery/performance

## Status: READY FOR TESTING

All identified issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Double-call bug fixed
- ✅ Language routing corrected  
- ✅ Database schema updated
