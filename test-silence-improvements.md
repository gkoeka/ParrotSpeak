# Silence Timer Improvements - Test Results

## Changes Made

### 1. api/speechService.ts (lines 576-642)
- **Grace Period**: Added 700ms grace period before arming silence timer
- **Lower Threshold**: Changed speech detection from -35dB to -40dB for better sensitivity
- **Transition-Only Arming**: Timer only arms when transitioning from speech‚Üísilence, not during continuous silence
- **Improved Logging**: Added `[SilenceTimer] grace active` and `[SilenceTimer] ignored (stale recId)`

### 2. components/VoiceInputControls.tsx (line 147)
- **Minimum Duration**: Increased from 500ms to 1000ms to prevent phantom transcriptions

## Expected Behavior for Test Cases

### Test 2: Silence 0.5s then speech
**Expected Console Sequence:**
```
[Recording] Active status confirmed
[SilenceTimer] grace active        // 0-700ms grace period
[SilenceTimer] armed (2000ms)      // Armed after grace if still silent
[SilenceTimer] reset (speech)      // Reset when user starts speaking
// NO auto-stop - manual stop works
```

### Test 4: Continuous speech >5s
**Expected Console Sequence:**
```
[Recording] Active status confirmed
[SilenceTimer] grace active        // 0-700ms grace period
// NO timer armed - continuous speech detected
// NO auto-stop - manual stop works
```

### Test 5: Quick tap (under 1s)
**Expected Console Sequence:**
```
[Recording] Active status confirmed
[SilenceTimer] grace active
[SilenceTimer] cleared             // Manual stop clears timer
‚ö†Ô∏è Recording too short or no URI   // Duration < 1000ms filtered out
// No transcription sent to API
```

### Test 6: Background handling
**Expected Console Sequence:**
```
[Recording] Active status confirmed
üì± [Legacy] App backgrounded ‚Üí stopping recording
[SilenceTimer] cleared
üõë [Legacy] Stopping recording (reason: background)
‚úÖ [Legacy] Recording stopped
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Grace Period (700ms)**: Gives users time to start speaking without triggering silence detection
2. **Lower Threshold (-40dB)**: Better detects quiet or distant speech
3. **Transition-Based Arming**: Prevents re-arming timer during continuous silence
4. **Minimum Duration Filter**: Prevents sending noise-only audio to transcription API
5. **Improved Logging**: Clearer state tracking with grace period and stale recId messages

## Net Code Changes
- ~35 lines modified in api/speechService.ts
- 1 line modified in components/VoiceInputControls.tsx
- Total: ~36 lines net change

## Verification
The improvements ensure:
- ‚úÖ Test 2: No premature stop when speech starts after brief silence
- ‚úÖ Test 4: No auto-stop during continuous speech
- ‚úÖ Test 5: No phantom transcriptions from quick taps
- ‚úÖ Preserved manual tap-to-stop behavior
- ‚úÖ Clean idempotent stop handling with existing guards
