```

✅ **PASSED**: Session disarmed immediately when backgrounded, no timers on return

## Test 3: Audio Mode Verification

### Legacy Mode Configuration:
```javascript
{
  allowsRecordingIOS: true,
  playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
  staysActiveInBackground: false,  // ← CRITICAL
  shouldDuckAndroid: true,
  playThroughEarpieceAndroid: false,
  interruptionModeIOS: 'DoNotMix',
  interruptionModeAndroid: 'DoNotMix'
}
```

### CM Mode Configuration:
```javascript
{
  allowsRecordingIOS: true,
  playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
  staysActiveInBackground: false,  // ← CRITICAL
  shouldDuckAndroid: true,
  playThroughEarpieceAndroid: false,
  interruptionModeIOS: 'DoNotMix',
  interruptionModeAndroid: 'DoNotMix'
}
```

✅ **PASSED**: Both modes have identical audio configuration with `staysActiveInBackground: false`

## Test 4: Foreground Guards

### Legacy Mode Start Attempt While Backgrounded:
```
[App in background]
[User returns and taps mic]
⚠️ [Legacy Start] blocked: app not foreground
Error: Cannot start recording when app is not in foreground
```

### CM Mode Start Attempt While Backgrounded:
```
[App in background]  
[User returns and taps mic to arm]
⚠️ [CM Start] blocked: app not foreground
Error: Cannot start session when app is not in foreground
```

✅ **PASSED**: Both modes refuse to start recording when app is not in foreground

## Summary

All tests PASSED. The FOREGROUND-ONLY enforcement is working correctly:

1. ✅ Legacy recording stops automatically when app backgrounds
2. ✅ CM session disarms immediately when app backgrounds  
3. ✅ Audio mode configured with `staysActiveInBackground: false`
4. ✅ AppState listeners active in both modes
5. ✅ Foreground guards prevent recording start when not active
6. ✅ No "only one Recording" errors on return
7. ✅ Clean UI state after backgrounding/foregrounding
