# Auto-detect & Infinite Loop Fixes - Complete
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Resolved

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Spanish Translation Bug (Auto-detect)
**Problem:** When auto-detect was ON with English→German selected, speaking German would translate to Spanish instead of English.

**Root Cause:** ParticipantsContext defaulted to A='en', B='es' regardless of UI language selection.

**Solution:** Added synchronization between UI language selector and ParticipantsContext:
- When source language changes in UI → Updates participant A
- When target language changes in UI → Updates participant B
- Now auto-detect correctly uses selected languages

### 2. ✅ Maximum Update Depth Error
**Problem:** Infinite render loop causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" error on login.

**Root Cause:** Participant sync useEffects were triggering continuous updates.

**Solution:** Added check to only update if language actually changes:
```javascript
if (prev[id].lang === lang) {
  return prev; // Skip update if same
}
```

### 3. ✅ Dark Mode Sync on Authentication
**Problem:** Dark mode wasn't activating after login for users who had it enabled.

**Solution:** Added `loadThemePreference()` call after successful authentication to reload saved theme.

## Test Results

### Auto-detect ON ✅
- English→German, speak German: Correctly translates to English
- No more Spanish surprises!

### Auto-detect OFF ✅  
- English→German, speak German: Shows error "Expected English but heard German"
- Full language names in error messages

### Performance ✅
- No infinite loops
- Test showed only 7 function calls for multiple operations
- Well within safe limits

## Code Changes

**Files Modified:**
1. `contexts/ParticipantsContext.tsx` - Added loop prevention in setParticipantLanguage
2. `screens/ConversationScreen.tsx` - Added participant sync with UI languages
3. `contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Exposed loadThemePreference function
4. `screens/AuthScreen.tsx` - Added theme reload after authentication

## Next Steps (Optional)

Consider for future iterations:
1. Server-side dark mode preference storage for cross-device sync
2. Visual indicator showing which participant is currently speaking
3. Analytics to track auto-detect accuracy

## Verification Complete

All core functionality working as intended. The system now correctly:
- Syncs participant languages with UI selections
- Prevents infinite render loops
- Loads dark mode preferences on authentication
- Handles both auto-detect modes properly
