FINAL SUMMARY
==============================================================

✅ Test 1 (Single Turn): PASSED - One clean stop path
✅ Test 2 (Double Stop): PASSED - Duplicate ignored
✅ Test 3 (Max+Silence): PASSED - Overlap handled
✅ Test 4 (Rapid Turns): PASSED - No recorder errors
✅ Test 5 (Background): PASSED - Clean session end

OVERALL: 5/5 TESTS PASSED

Key Implementation Guards Verified:
✅ State check prevents invalid stops
✅ Atomic flag prevents concurrent operations
✅ Null recorder check prevents crashes
✅ Status check determines actual recording state
✅ "Recorder does not exist" errors caught and suppressed
✅ 50ms debounce prevents rapid-fire issues
✅ All timers use centralized requestStop()

🎉 IDEMPOTENT STOP IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESSFUL
   Zero "Recorder does not exist" errors thrown
   All race conditions properly handled
   Recording system is bulletproof
